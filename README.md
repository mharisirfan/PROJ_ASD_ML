**ML Project: Autism Spectrum Detection**

## Problem Statement
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition.  
Early detection is critical, as timely interventions can significantly improve outcomes.

### Issues with current diagnostic practices
- Rely heavily on behavioral assessments
- Are time-intensive
- Are subjective
- Result in delayed diagnoses

Recent studies suggest that subtle facial morphology differences are associated with ASD in children.

## Project Approach
We prepared the dataset and split the work to experiment with different models, with the aim of jointly selecting the best-performing one.

## Models Evaluated
We tested multiple models locally using Google Drive and uploaded the two best-performing options to GitHub:

- Custom-built CNN models
- MobileNetV2
- VGG-19
- ResNet-50
- DenseNet-121
- Xception
- **EfficientNet-B0** — minimal false negatives
- **InceptionV3** — good overall fit

## Code Location
- **EfficientNet-B0** → code can be found in `scripts/`
- **InceptionV3** → code can be found in `scripts/`
